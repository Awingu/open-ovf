Contributing to Open-ovf
========================

License
-------

The project is licensed under EPL v1.0, so any contribution will be made
under this license. Make sure you read the LICENSE file, in case you have
doubts about the license.


Code/Patches
------------

1) Always run the test suite before sending out patches. Please ensure all
tests still pass and you didn't introduce any new bug.

The scripts available in examples are also good for testing, and should be
used to perform complete tests. Later the test suite will include
complete tests as well.

2) Use pylint to check the coding style and possible errors. Please
do not add code that makes pylint complain. A 10/10 rating is the goal.
Check the Coding style section below to see how to use pylint.

3) Use epydoc syntax to document new classes/methods/functions/etc.
Check http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/ for help.

You can use "epydoc --check <package/file.py>" to verify what is not
documented yet.

4) Patches should be in unified diff format (preferably using git).

5) Make sure your patch applies correctly in the git tree in the day
you're sending the patch out. Use a local personal branch to develop
your feature and keep that in sync with the main tree (check
"git rebase").

6) Patches should be sent to open-ovf-devel@lists.sourceforge.net


Coding style
------------

The coding style used in open-ovf is mostly what is defined on
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/, except for the naming
convention, that follows CapitalizedWords/camelCase.

There is a pylintrc config file (extras/pylintrc), that can be used
to tell pylint to accept CapitalizedWords names.

You can save pylintrc as ~/.pylintrc and that will be used
by default, or you can call pylint like this:

  pylint --rcfile=<path_to_open-ovf>/extras/pylintrc <module/file>
